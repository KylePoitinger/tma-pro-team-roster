# tma-pro-team-roster
pro team roster for tma

app should just run locally, endpoints are defined in controller classes

memory is h2

my thought process going through this application was to make it easy to read,
reading through legacy code is part of my job, and having badly written code
can almost cripple any development

at this point, the only issue that I can't solve is getting my maven dependencies for
unit tests working. First attempt was with mockito, and then spring runner, baeldung help, referencing college textbooks and code from work.

I am just at a loss for why my junit annotations are not being pulled in correctly, so i'll comment them out.
